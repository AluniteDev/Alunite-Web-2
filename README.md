# Alunite Web 2
Maybe a new website for Alunite Community!

The old website for Alunite Community was a bit old and dodgy so we decided to redo it and try and make it compatable for mobile as much as possible!

This website will once again use node.js to display the member count etc. but that this point we are just trying to get the design done.
